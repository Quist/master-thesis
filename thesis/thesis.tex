\section{Problem Statement}
Most of the Web Service solutions used today are aimed for civilian use and does
not necessarily perform well in military environments. In contrast to civilian
networks where bandwidth are abundant, mobile tactical networks may suffer
from high error rates and low bandwidth.

In my master thesis I will investigate different optimization techniques that
can be applied to improve communication. In order for the clients and services
 to remain interoperable the optimization techniques will be placed in proxies.

The Web Services will communicate with his counter part over HTTP as regular,
with all traffic going umerkelig through the proxy. The Web Service itself does
not need to pay attention to the bad connectivity, the proxy will choose the
appropriate protocol and configuration.
