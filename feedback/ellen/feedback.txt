Hi Joakim

Many apologies for my late reply. I was doing fieldwork in Zambia and thought I would have internet and therefore could send my comments from there, but this turned out not to be the case. Hence, I send you some comments on your essay now.

I think its a very interesting thesis topic, and you have researched it well. My only struggle with your essay was the many problem statements, and trying to figure out as a reader ' why am i reading about this.. will you be researching this or not?' .I would recommend that in your thesis, you have one section where you discuss the main sort of 'overall' problem, then the several approaches out there to tackel this problem that all have their own challenges, and then be clear about what you will look at and what you won't be looking at and why. But at this stage, that is not expected and it is good you are looking at it broadly.

Formulating a research question (doesnt have to be very specific) may help you to identify the 'overall' problem and narrow down directions aswell. Also, make sure to be very clear on what a design approach methodology involves in writing up your work. I am not familair with this research approach, but I expect there are requirements on how to gather and analyse your data specific to this approach that you will be marked on later. I would say the learning process of sort of narrowing down your focus will be interesting to describe in your thesis, as part of the design cycle you described.

I added the document with the comments should it be helpfull, but I wouldnt worry to much about the writing at this stage. When you are ready to write up your findings, feel free to pop me an email if you would like a second set of eyes to look at your work.I can't advice you on the content but more on structuring your argument and presenting the work.

All the best!
