\chapter{Related Work}

In this chapter we will discuss earlier relevant work in the area of improving
the performance of Web services in dil environments. We will try to identify
results and recommendations that are applicable to this thesis. Furthermore, we
will discuss existing proxies and what they offer.

IST-090 ser på muligheten av å bruke SOA på taktisk nivå, med spesielt fokus på
disadvantged grids. Fokuserer på mulighet for Web services across disadvantaged
networks. Samt Data Distribution Service(DDS) på taktisk nivå.

In the report IST-090, a task group investigated solutions for making \gls{soa}
applicable at the tactical level. Three key issues that needs to be addressed in
order to apply Web Services in tactical networks were
identified\cite{ist-118,ist-090}:

\label{section:DIL-problems}

\subsubsection{End-to-end connections}

Web Services depend on a direct, end-to-end connection between the client and
the service. Attempting to establish and maintaining connections in DIL
environments can lead to increased communication overhead and possible complete
breakdown of communication. Most Web Services use TCP as the transport protocol,
which is a connection-oriented protocol designed for wired networks. In DIL
environments with high error rates and high latencies, the congestion control of
TCP will cause sub-optimal utilization of the network due to frequent connection
timeouts. Similar, HTTP, which is the application layer protocol most often
used together with TCP, struggles in such environments. HTTP is a synchronous
protocol which means that the HTTP connection is kept open until a response is
received. Long response time cause timeouts. IST-090 points out the obvious
solution to replace HTTP and TCP with other, more suitable protocols.

The report mentions two approaches to replace HTTP/TCP. The clients and services
itself can be modified to support other protocols, or proxies which support
alternative protocols can be used. With employing a proxy solution, standards
compliance can be retained.


\subsubsection{Network heterogeneity}

Another issue is when heterogeneous networks are interconnected. Different
performance in networks may lead to buildup of data in buffers, risking loss of
information. A proposed solution to this is to have store-and-forward support
which can support that messages are not dropped, but stored and forwarded when
possible.


\subsubsection{Web Service overhead}

Web services generate overhead as the Web Service technology is based on SOAP,
which use XML-based messages. It is a textual data format and produce much
larger messages than binary formats. Optimization approaches should seek to
reduce the network traffic generated by Web services by using techniques as
compression to reduce the size of messages. Another approach is to reduce the
number of messages being sent, which was looked into in IST-090\cite{ist-090}. In
their work they investigated three different ways to do this:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Employing caching near the client in order to reuse older messages.
    \item Using publish/subscribe paradigm, which allows clients to subscribe to
    information instead of requesting it. This allows the same message to be sent
    to multiple clients.
    \item Employing content filtering, which filters out unnecessary data.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Proxies}

This section lists previous implementations of proxies designed to work in
\gls{dil} environments.


\subsubsection{DSProxy}

DSProxy is a proxy solution developed by \gls{ffi} which transports SOAP
messages over DIL networks. It reduces bandwidth needs by employing different
optimization techniques such as compression. It also provides delay tolerance
which allows \gls{cots} clients to function in DIL networks.


\subsubsection{AFRO}

\gls{afro} is an edge proxy which offers different levels of \gls{qos} to Web
Services through performance monitoring and application of the context-aware
service provision paradigm. It perform so called adaption actions, which
modifies the SOAP XML messages by changing their encoding to more efficient data
representation. It also cuts out information that are accepted to be removed by
the service requester. However, since the proxy modifies the data being sent,
the checksum of the data is also changed. In applications where we want to be
sure that no one has tempered with the data before arriving, checksums is often
used. Therefor this solution would not work for such applications.

\subsection{Evaluation of Transport Protocols}

Previous studies have investigated potential gains from replacing HTTP/TCP
with alternative transport protocols
\cite{evaluation-transport-protocols-web-services}. They looked into how TCP,
UDP, SCTP and AMQP for conveying Web services traffic under typical military
networking conditions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \gls{sctp} has the highest success rate in military tactical
    communication. However, on the lower bandwidth links the protocols tends to
     generate more overhead than TCP. Due to SCTP has a more complex connection
     handshake procedure and in addition use heartbeat packets.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Configuration}
IST-90: Configure HTTP on the application server or ESP to prevent time-outs.

plasseres i proxier.


\subsection{Compression}

\gls{xml} is the data format used by Web Services and has a significant
overhead. Previous studies have evaluated different compressions algorithms for
Web services. Previous experiments shows EFX has the compression results with
GZIP as the second best alternative\cite{johnsen-trude-compression-techniqes}.


\section{Summary}

As discussed in this chapter, there exist research and experiments targeting
SOAP-based Web services in \gls{dil} environments. Proxies have been created but
their are either limited to SOAP-based Web Services or are inadequate to be used
due to security reasons.
