\chapter{Introduction}

Military units may operate under conditions where the reliability of the network
connection is low. They can operate far from existing communication
infrastructure and rely only on wireless communication. Such networks are often
characterized by unreliable connections with low date rate and high error rates
making data communication difficult. In a military scenario it is necessary for
units at all operational levels to seamlessly exchange information across
different types of communication systems. This ranges from foot soldiers with
radio equipment operating on the battlefield, to the commanding officer in a far
away headquarter full of computers. To \gls{nato}, this concept is referred to
as \gls{nec}. In a feasibility study, \gls{nato} identified the \gls{soa}
paradigm and the Web Service technology as key enablers for
such information exchange\cite{nnec-study}.

Web Service technology is well tested and in widespread use in civil
applications where the network is stable and the data rate is abundant. However,
certain military networks suffer from high error rates and very low date rate,
which can leave Web Services built for civilian use unusable. This thesis
investigate how these challenges can be overcome by applying optimization
techniques at different layers of the protocol stack.


\section{Background and Motivation}

\gls{nato} is a military alliance consisting of 28 member
countries\cite{nato-homepage-member-countries} and which primary goal is to
protect the freedom and security of its members through political and military
means. In joint military operations the relatively large number of member
countries can be a challenge when setting up machine-to machine information
exchange. Differences in communication systems and equipment attribute to making
the integration of such systems more difficult. In order to address this issue,
NATO has chosen the \gls{soa} concept\cite{nnec-study}.

\subsection{Service-Oriented Architecture}
\glsentryfull{soa} is an architectural pattern where application components
provide services to other components over a network. \gls{soa} is built on
concepts such as object-orientation and distributed computing and aims to get
a loose coupling between clients and services. In their reference model for
\gls{soa}, the \gls{oasis} define \gls{soa} as\cite{oasis-soa-reference-model}:

\paragraph{}

\textit{Service Oriented Architecture is a paradigm for organizing and utilizing
distributed capabilities that may be under the control of different ownership
domains. It provides a uniform means to offer, discover, interact with and use
capabilities to produce desired effects consistent with measurable preconditions
and expectations.} % SOA Trekant figur her

\paragraph{}

In \gls{soa}, business processes are divided into smaller chunks of business
logic, referred to as \textit{services}. A service can be business related, e.g
a patient register service, or a infrastructure service used by other services
and not by a user application. \gls{oasis} define a service as:

\paragraph{}
\textit{
A service is a mechanism to enable access to one or more capabilities, where the
access is  provided using a prescribed interface and is exercised consistent
with constraints and policies as  specified by the service description
}

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{The three roles in SOA(from \cite{ist-090})}
\end{figure}

Services are provided by \textit{service providers} and are consumed by
\textit{service consumers}. The service provider is responsible for creating a
service description, making the service available to others and implementing the
service according to the service description. Services are made available to
service consumers through a form of \textit{service discovery}. This can be a
static configuration, or more dynamic with a central \textit{service registry},
where service providers publish service descriptions. Service consumers find the
services they need by contacting the service registry. The communication between
services occur through the exchange of standardized messages.

Following the \gls{soa} principles dictates a very loose coupling between
services and the consumers of those. This allows software systems to be more
flexible, as new components can be integrated with minimal impact on the
existing system. Another aspect of loose coupling is with regard to time, which
enable services and its consumers to not be available at the same instance of
time. This enables asynchronous communication. Loose coupling with regards to
location allows the location of an service to be changed without needing to
reprogram, reconfigure, or restart the service consumers. This is possible
through the usage of service discovery, which is dynamic retrieval of the
new location of the service.

 Furthermore \gls{soa} enables service implementation neutrality. The
 implementation of service is completely separated from the service description.
 This allows re-implementation and alteration of a service without affecting the
 service consumers. Thus this can attribute to keep development costs low and
 avoiding proprietary solutions and vendor lock-in. Another benefit with
 \gls{soa} is re-usability by dividing common business processes into services,
 which may help cost reduction and avoids duplication. \gls{soa} is only a
 pattern and the concepts can be realized by a range of technologies. The most
 common used approach is the Web service familiy of standards, using the SOAP
 messaging protocol. To achieve interoperability between systems from different
 nations and vendors, NATO has chosen the Web Service technology in order to
 realize the \gls{soa}  principles\cite{soa-baseline}. This allows member
 nations to implement their own technology as long as they adhere to the
 standards. The Web service technology is discussed in detail in
 \cref{web-services}. Another approach to \gls{soa} is \gls{rest}, which use
 HTTP over TCP. \gls{rest} has gained a lot of traction in the civil industry
 and is discussed in section \cref{rest}.


\subsection{Military Networks}

Web services are in widespread use both in civilian and military applications.
Military networks are complex and consist of many different heterogeneous
network technologies. We can group them into layers which have different
chararistics as can been seen in \cref{figure:military-networks}. At the highest
level, there is fixed infrastructure and relatively static users, meaning that
they seldom move around or disconnects. At the lower levels, there are fewer
units, but they are much more dynamic. The lower level is called tactical
networks which is discussed in the next paragraph.

\label{figure:military-networks}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Tactical Networks}
Tactical networks are characterized by that the units are deployed to operate in
a battlefield, which means there is no existing communication infrastructure.
They use tactical communication equipment which includes technologies like VHF,
UHF, HF, tactical broadband and satellites\cite{ist-090}.
% Mangler referanse på bruk av satelitter.

Examples of such units are mobile units like vehicles, foot soldiers and field
headquarters. The tactical network connects deployed headquarters with mobile
units. These types of networks are unpredictable and may have very low date
rate, possibly high delay, high error rates and frequent disconnections. They
are often called disadvantaged grids or \gls{dil} environments, which is the term used in
this thesis. \gls{dil} is discussed in \cref{dil}.

NATO studies\cite{nato-disadvantaged-grids} have identified such networks to
have the following characteristics:
\\\\
\textit{
Disadvantaged grids are characterized by low bandwidth,variable throughput,
unreliable connectivity, and energy constraints imposed by the wireless
communications grid that link the nodes}.
\paragraph{}
The characteristics of these networks and what challenges they impose are
discussed in detail in \cref{dil}.

\section{Example scenario}

Tenkte her å introdusere et scenario som illustererer problemer og utfordringer
med DIL nettverk.

\section{Problem Statement}
Most of the Web Service solutions used today are aimed for civilian use and do
not necessarily perform well in military environments. In contrast to civilian
networks where the date rate is abundant, mobile tactical networks may suffer
from high error rates and low date rate. Adapting Web service solutions meant
for civil networks directly for military purposes may not be possible.
Therefore, Web services needs to be adapted in order to handle network
challenges. However, it can be very expensive to alter existing Web service
technology and incorporate proprietary solutions. A NATO research task group has
previously identified the foundation on open standards to avoid tighter coupling
between service providers and consumers\cite{ist-090}. It is much better to use
\gls{cots} software. By placing the optimization in proxies, the
Web Services can remain unchanged.

The goal of this thesis is to investigate different optimization techniques that
can be applied in order to improve Web service performance in \gls{dil}
networks. In order for the clients and services to remain interoperable the
optimization techniques will be placed in proxies. The Web Services will
communicate as normal, while all network traffic is tunneled through a proxy.
The Web Service itself does not need to pay attention to the bad connectivity,
the proxy will choose the appropriate protocol and configuration.

\section{Premises}
The Web services and clients do not need to be changed.

\section{Scope and Limitations}
Sikkerhet er ikke adressert i denne oppgaven(skal kanskje se på IPsec).

SOAP over HTTP klart det mest brukte, samt rest er utelukkende på HTTP. Derfor
støtter proxien kun HTTP ut og inn.

\section{Research Methodology}

\section{Contribution}

The outcome of this thesis is a recommendation regarding which optimizations
techniques which can be used in DIL to enhance the performance of Web services.
Aswell as a prototype implementation of a DIL proxy.
