\chapter{Requirement Analysis}
As discussed in \cref{section:DIL-problems}, the dependency on end-to-end
connections needs to be removed. This can be done by adding proxies to the
network. Mobile units have to carry batteries with them and the capacity is
therefore limited. Advanced compression techniques may reduce the overhead, but
also requires more battery. This trade-off needs to be considered.
